# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone using HTML, CSS (SCSS), JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end and Node, Express and MongoDB for the back-end.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Ensure your MongoDB server is running.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. Empty list? Is your brain trying to send you a message online? Don't panic! This is because your database of tweets doesn't contain any tweets at the moment.
6. Click the `compose` button in the top right and write your first tweet!
7. Keep talking to yourself via writing messages and try restarting the server to see that the messages persist.
