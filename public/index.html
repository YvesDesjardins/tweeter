        Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my
        brains
        out all over your naked bodies. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Your blood will be my
        lotion! S-S-Samantha.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please. cell phone, no no no rotary... and payphone on
        half.
        Aw, geez. I'm Mr. Crowbar, and here is my friend, who is also a crowbar! Want to piss on him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa! That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures
        Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because
        in
        this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves
        and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 You're talking about Inception? You don't
        know me!
      </p>
      <p>
        He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. You’re like Hitler, but
        even Hitler cared about Germany or something. Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
        Grassss... Taste bad!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my
        brains
        out all over your naked bodies. Cause he roped me into this! It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way
        up
        your butt. He's not pressing charges. That's gotta be the you shot me equivalent of not being mad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.
        Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll
        be fine! Don't Morty me! I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break
        from this kind of shit! But no! Like father, like goddamn daughter! You wanna be like Rick?! Congratulations!
        You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible! I don't get it, and I don't need to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summer, next time we're hiding in a chlorkian echo nest, can you do me a favour and turn your ringer off?! We
        will return… possibly in different clothing. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks, what about your short game? Nice
        to wheat you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand!
        Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic,
        walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! There's pros and cons to
        every alternate timeline. Fun facts about this one – It's got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s, and the best
        ice cream in the multiverse! Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love is just a
        chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your
        mothers
        ovaries!
      </p>
      <p>
        I just wanna die! We're gonna nine eleven this bitch unless Morty gets better math grades! You don't know me!
        Full disclosure, Morty - it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the Megaseeds
        dissolving
        in your rectal cavity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nice, Mrs Pancakes. Real nice. Snuffles was my slave name. You can call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty
        and
        white. Shut the fuck up about moonmen! What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or
        something?
